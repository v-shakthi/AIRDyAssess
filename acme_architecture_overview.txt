ACME Corporation — IT Architecture & Strategy Overview
======================================================
Document Type: Internal Architecture Review
Version: 2024 Q3
Department: Office of the CTO

1. CURRENT STATE INFRASTRUCTURE
--------------------------------
ACME operates a hybrid cloud environment with approximately 60% of workloads on-premises
and 40% migrated to AWS (primary) and Azure (secondary). The on-premises infrastructure
runs on VMware vSphere 7.0 and consists of 420 virtual machines across two data centres
in Chicago and Dallas.

Cloud adoption began in 2021, initially focused on dev/test workloads. Production 
migrations are ongoing. Key production systems — including the ERP (SAP S/4HANA) and 
core banking platform — remain on-premises due to regulatory constraints and integration
complexity.

Network: Cisco Catalyst backbone, MPLS interconnects between data centres. SD-WAN 
rollout is 70% complete across 45 branch offices.

2. DATA LANDSCAPE
-----------------
Data is distributed across multiple systems with limited integration:
- Operational data: SAP S/4HANA, Salesforce CRM, ServiceNow ITSM
- Analytics: On-premises SQL Server data warehouse (7TB, updated nightly via batch ETL)
- Unstructured data: SharePoint Online (document management), Exchange Online (email)
- IoT/sensor data: 1,200 manufacturing floor sensors, data currently siloed in SCADA systems

Data quality is a known concern. A 2023 internal audit found that 34% of customer records
had at least one data quality issue (missing fields, duplicates, or format inconsistencies).
No formal data quality monitoring or data catalogue is in place.

Data governance: A Data Governance Committee was established in 2022 but meets
infrequently and has not yet produced a formal data policy framework.

3. APPLICATION PORTFOLIO
-------------------------
ACME runs 87 enterprise applications. Of these:
- 12 are classified as "strategic" (core to operations)
- 31 are "standard" (important but replaceable)
- 44 are "legacy" (end-of-life risk; 18 have no vendor support)

API maturity is low — most integrations rely on point-to-point connections or batch file
transfers. An API gateway (Kong) was deployed in 2023 but covers only 8 systems.

3. AUTOMATION & AI INITIATIVES
-------------------------------
Current automation capabilities:
- RPA: 14 attended and unattended bots in production (UiPath), primarily in Finance
  (invoice processing, reconciliation) and HR (onboarding paperwork)
- Business rules: ~40% of customer service inquiries handled by rule-based chatbot
  (satisfaction score: 2.8/5)
- No machine learning models in production as of Q3 2024

AI exploration:
- Proof of concept completed for document classification (accuracy: 73%, not productionised)
- 3 business units have independently subscribed to ChatGPT Enterprise
  (no central governance or usage monitoring in place)

4. TEAM & SKILLS
-----------------
IT organisation: 280 FTE
- Infrastructure & Ops: 95
- Application Development: 85
- Data & Analytics: 32 (4 data engineers, 2 data analysts, 1 BI developer, 25 report writers)
- Security: 18
- Architecture: 12

Data science / ML capability: 0 dedicated data scientists. One engineer in the Data team
has completed an online ML course. No MLOps capability.

AI literacy: An internal survey in 2024 found that 68% of IT staff had not used any AI
tool in their work in the past 6 months. 12% use AI tools regularly.

Training budget: $800K per year for IT training. No dedicated AI upskilling programme exists.

5. GOVERNANCE & COMPLIANCE
---------------------------
Regulatory environment: ACME operates in financial services and is subject to SOX, 
GDPR (EU customer data), and state-level data privacy laws.

AI governance: No formal AI policy. Legal and Compliance teams have flagged AI use as
a priority risk area following regulatory guidance from the Federal Reserve (SR 11-7)
on model risk management.

A draft "AI Acceptable Use Policy" is under review but has not been approved.

6. STRATEGIC CONTEXT
---------------------
ACME's 3-year digital transformation strategy (approved by the Board in 2023) identifies
"AI-augmented operations" as a top-3 strategic priority. The CEO has publicly committed
to "becoming an AI-native organisation by 2027."

Budget: $4.2M has been allocated for AI and automation initiatives in FY2025, a 3x 
increase from FY2024.

Executive sponsor: The CTO leads the AI agenda. A Chief Data Officer role has been
approved but not yet filled.

Key strategic pain points identified for AI:
- Customer service: High cost-to-serve ($18 average cost per contact vs industry $9)
- Fraud detection: Rule-based system generates 40% false positive rate
- Supply chain: Manual demand forecasting; significant inventory overage ($12M annually)
- Compliance reporting: 3 FTE spend 80% of time on manual regulatory report compilation
- Employee productivity: Knowledge management is poor; employees cannot easily find
  internal policies and procedures (avg search time: 22 minutes per query)
